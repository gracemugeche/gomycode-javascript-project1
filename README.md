# Edabit Problem-Solving Challenge

## Overview
In this project, I participated in the Edabit problem-solving game. I created an account, solved multiple challenges at varying difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard), and collected a significant amount of points in order to complete the task.

## Task Completion
I have solved problems from different categories, earning points for each solution. My goal was to achieve more than 100 points, and I focused on solving challenging tasks in order to improve my skills.
